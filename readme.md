LIGHTphpCDN
=======
<p>This project is an light weight mirror manage system wrote in php.</p>
##Why open this project?
<p>Many Server on the Internet is fast,but they can only use php as the server script. You can't 
use the existing system to manage them if you want to use them as your file server. You have to
use FTP to send file between them.So I just make this little tool to send data between servers.</p>
